<h1 align="center">Synapse Test 🧠</h1>

**Synapse Test** is a next-generation network diagnostic tool powered by Synapse. Unlike traditional speed tests that only focus on raw throughput, this tool evaluates the true Quality of Experience (QoE).

- 🌀 **Vortex** (Performance): Measures flow efficiency based on speed, latency, jitter, and packet loss.
- 📡 **Radiance** (Signal): Measures the physical quality of the wireless environment (SNR & Channel Width). (Not done)
- 🏆 **Axon** (Health): The unified score representing the real-world stability of the connection. (Not done)
